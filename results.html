<p style= text-align:left;> As you notice with the budgets they are quite strict with savings, but that is because it is better to save now and spend later. Only dipping into other percentage categories when absolutely necessary. This is because as you age, although spending on dependents lessen, personal expenses increase as medical injury increases.

It is also important to recognize that some times you will spend more or less than your budget and for that money to roll over into the next time frame can help with times to splurge.
