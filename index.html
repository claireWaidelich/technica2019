	<p>Hello!</p>
	<p>Here's how you can start saving....</p>
	<p>The first step to opening up a savings account is first researching which savings account is best for you. A high-yield savings account means that the bank will pay you a higher percentage to keep your money in that particular savings account. There are some online banks that have high yield rates between 1 and 2%. The second step is to make sure you have all your important documents in order to open up your first savings account! The important documents you will need is are a driverâ€™s license, government issued ID passport, social security number, recent addresses, and bank account number/routing number. The last step is to start using your new savings account! The easiest way to start saving is to set up automatic transfers from your checking account. Also, another tip is to download the mobile app so you can have your finances in easy access.</p>

	<p>Hello!</p>
	<p>Let's talk about making a monthly budget....</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The first step to create a good budget is to understand what your net income is.</li>
		<li>Track you spending: by tracking your spending, you will know how much money you are spending in which area and where you need to cut back on.</li>
		<li>Set goals: take some time to write down all of your long and short term goals. This will make the process of spending less money much easier. For an example, if you would like to study abroad during the summer time, it will be an easier process to save up money. Also, in order to stay organized, it is helpful to start saving receipts by utilizing tools such as Adobe.</li>
		<li>Make a solid plan and keep checking in: Make informed decisions when spending your money. Can you skip more dinners out with your friends and only attend special birthday dinners? These are questions you have the power to analyze and make financial decisions.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>To find your monthly budget, divide your annual income by 12.<p>
